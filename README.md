# full-stack-storefront

<p>I created this Node.js server entirely from scratch with no pre-existing code snippets.</p>
<p>It features an admin page where users can enter product names, descriptions and prices into an HTML form which then uses express.js routing and the express-handlebars templating engine to dynamically display that content along with a randomly generated image in a responsive grid on the "Shop" page.</p>
<p>This project is focused primarily on back-end technologies and demonstrates knowledge in the following topics:</p>

<ul>
<li>Node.js server architecture & event looping
<li>Express.js route management with middleware (.set, .use, .get, .post, .render, .redirect, .status, etc.)
<li>Dynamic page content utilizing user input to update page data
<li>Templating engines, specifically express-handlebars
<li>Parsing and routing data
<li>Express router for multi-layer server paths
<li>Creation of utility/helper functions for path management
<li>Placeholder/Representative content to demonstrate minimal viable product implementation
</ul>

<p>Though this project utilizes CSS & basic HTML metadata, it is NOT a demonstration of SEO, CSS or design knowledge and should not be treated as such.</p>
